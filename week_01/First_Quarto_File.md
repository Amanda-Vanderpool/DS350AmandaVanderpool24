-   What is unique of good about the visualization?
-   What could be better?

#### Article 1:

<https://ourworldindata.org/human-height>

In this article there are multiple visualizations. Looking at beyond the first visualization you see graphs that are interactive showing heights in birth year and even place. It is unique to see graphs done in this way so you can really drill down to what you specifically want to look at. I think the first graph specifically could have been better by including a key to help ou see specifically between USA and Sweden.

#### Article 2:

<https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production>

In this article I liked how they used a line chart to show the meet production in years and by area. The interactive line chart made it easy to focus on just certain years and also see which place had the most meat production overtime. I struggled with the first graph because it looked like a staked graph was used so it could be considered confusing as which area had the most meat production. The area size was accurate but did not accurately line up with the numbers so if you were not looking at the data you could get inaccurate information.

#### Article 3:

<https://abcnews.go.com/538/trump-leads-swing-state-polls-tied-biden-nationally/story?id=109506070>

In this article I like how they label the precentages on the side of the visualization. I think it brings more attention to the percentage of votes for each person. I think it is unique to add the uncertainty levels in there with a faded color so that the audience sees the variation of the data. One thing I thing may be better specifically for this article and data is using emphasized numbers instead of a graph. I think you would get the same information across but limit the noise on the page by stating plainly what the data is.
